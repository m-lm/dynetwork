# Dynetwork

Todo: complete dynamic graph visualization feature

Dynetwork is a network analysis program written in Python for Shakespeare plays. It extracts character relationships by identifying implicit and explicit interactions and generates the social network accordingly for each play. In addition, it tracks temporal information, enabling dynamic graph analysis on scene-by-scene snapshots.

Pyvis-generated HTML files for interactive graph visualizations can be found [here](https://github.com/m-lm/shakespeare-networks), and `.graphml` files can be found in the `exports` directory.
